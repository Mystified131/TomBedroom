ere is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks, 
the lady of situations, 
here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel, 
a heap of broken images, where the sun beats, 
and the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, 
the glitter of her jewels rose to meet it, 
from satin cases poured in rich profusion,
in vials of ivory and coloured glass, 
which an age of prudence can never retract, 
by this, and this only, we have existed, 
which is not to be found in our obituaries, 
you know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember, 
nothing, 
i remember, 
glowed on the marble, where the glass, 
held up by standards wrought with fruited vines, 
a heap of broken images, where the sun beats, 
and the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, 
and the dry stone no sound of water. Only, 
the rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear, 
a rat crept softly through the vegetation, 
looking into the heart of light, the silence,
