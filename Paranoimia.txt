Relax
You're quite safe here,

Am I dreaming, no
Where am I, in bed
Well, what am I doing
Oh, talking to myself,

Look, I must have
A star on my door
Or better still
A door-a door
Ah, swing doors up
okay doors, swing,

Swing,

Swing,

Now I know I'm dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming,

Hmmm, how do I get to sleeep
I know, I'll count
Those bars on the window
One, two, three, sleep,

How do I get
How do I get to sleep
Please let me sleep
poetry, that'll work,

Come sweet slumber
Enshroud me in thy purple cloak
Hmmm, doesn't even rhyme,

Is that my teas made

I cant stand tea
Tea, tea, tea, tea,

Ahhh, Happy Harry's High Club
How do I, how am I
Gonna get to sleep,

Trust me, trust me,
